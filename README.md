# aWhereCharts Library

This package of functions is designed to work primarily with the aWhere API, and users should first research and install the [aWhereAPI](https://github.com/aWhereAPI/aWhere-R-Library "aWhereAPI") package, and ensure they can make calls to the API and retrieve data. Users without an API account may sign up for a [trial account](www.developer.awhere.com).

The aWhereCharts package helps users accomplish a host of simple analytic tasks to get them started performing exploratory weather and agronomic charting as quickly as possible.
