# Contributing Code to aWhere Repositories

We welcome contributions to our code samples, libraries, SDKs, widgets, sample applications, and other code resources hosted through GitHub. Please feel free to fork, edit, add, and then send us your changes through a pull request. Someone from our team will review your code, work with you to make any adjustments, and then merge it into our public repo. 

Contributed code or edits will become part of the main repository offered by aWhere, Inc., and governed by the license designated in the GitHub repository (usually the MIT License). By contributing code or edits to code, you are agreeing to release any claim of copyright, royalty, or exclusivity for the use of the code. You also grant aWhere a universal and irrevocable right to publish, edit, use the code in our products (free or commercial), publish the code on our Developers Portal (developer.awhere.com), and other reasonable purposes. You're also allowing for other developers, both independent and commercial, to use your contributed code in their projects. 

Contributed code will be attributed to you with your name and/or github username, plus website or email address if desired. Edits to your contributed code may bring additional attributions, but your name will not be removed. Attributions may be made in an ancillary file provided with the repo. 

We cannot guarantee that all contributed code will be merged into the repository, and we may choose to unpublish or delete any code or repository at any time. 

Please send questions to api@awhere.com.
