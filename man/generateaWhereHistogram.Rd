\description{
\code{generateaWhereHistogram} Generate a histogram of 1-2 weather variables with standardized formatting.
}
\details{
This function generates a histogram with standardized formatting in ggplot's gray theme. This 
function was created to work with the large datasets covering entire regions transferred by 
aWhere to clients, enabling them to examine variation in the current conditions of a region 
for any variable, as well as compare current vs. long-term normals. Technically, however, the 
function can work with any dataset, since unlike with the generateaWhereChart and 
generateaWhereStdDevChart functions, the input variable names are not restricted.
